## Lesson 1 Excuse me.
### Text
```
Excuse me!
Yes?
Is this your handbag?
Pardon?
Is this your handbag?
Yes, it is.
Thank you very much.
```

### Notes
```
1.Excuse me!  动词，使对方注意自己
在汉语中的意思是原谅我！

2.陈述句和一般疑问句
陈述句中Be动词提前变疑问句
This is ...
Is this ...?

3．Pardon？感叹词，意为：对不起，请再说一遍。
当我们没听清或没理解对方的话并希望对方能重复一遍时，就可以使用这一表达方式。
在汉语中的意思相当于"对不起，请再说一遍"或者"对不起，请再说一遍好吗？"
```

### Grammar
一、主谓宾

`名词在主词位置用主格,宾语位置用宾格.`

<style>

{
  width: auto;
  display: table;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;

|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|

|you|you|your|
|he|him|his|
|she|her|her|
|it|it|its|
</div>

`形容词性物主代词:表示所属关系，对应汉语中的 “我的” “你的” “TA的”。`

二、陈述句->疑问句

This <u>is</u> a car. -> <u>Is</u> this your car?

① Be动词放句子最开头.

② 陈述句降调变疑问句的升词。

三、回答 Is this ...? 的提问

- 肯定：Yes,it is. &ensp; `it is 连读`

- 否定：No,it isn't. &ensp; `isn't = is not `
